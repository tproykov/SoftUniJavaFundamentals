// Write a program to calculate the winner of a car race. You will receive an
// array of numbers. Each array element represents the time needed to pass
// through that step (the index). There are going to be two cars. One of them
// starts from the left side, and the other one starts from the right side.
// The middle index of the array is the finish line. (The number of elements
// of the array will always be odd). Calculate the total time for each racer
// to reach the finish (the middle of the array) and print the winner with his
// total time. (The racer with less time). If you have a zero in the array, you
// must reduce the racer's time that reached it by 20% (from the time so far).
//Print the result in the following format "The winner is {left/right} with
// total time: {total time}", formatted with one digit after the decimal point.
